Git:
    - gitignore Statements can be negated by using !
        - all parent folders must be "reactivated"

Java:

    - boolean-Statements: 
        - AND binds stronger than OR.

    - Array-Lists:
        - remove removes the first of the matching Elements.

    - Arrays:
        - can be iterated by an for-each loop. 

    - Switch-Statements:
        - it is possible to write every possible outcome as a Value to a Variable.
            -> example:
                int result =
                    switch (operation) {
                        case "+" -> x;
                        case "*" -> y;
                        case "/" -> y;
                        ...
                    };

    - O3 ist extrem stark.
