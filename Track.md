# LL:

Git:
    - gitignore Statements can be negated by using !
        - all parent folders must be "reactivated"

Java:

    - if-Statements:
        - can be written in a single line while not using {}.

    - ternary operator:
        - dont use variable--, beacause only variable (wihtout reduction) is returned.

    - String:
        - .format:
            - escape for % is: %%.

    - boolean-Statements: 
        - AND binds stronger than OR.

    - Array-Lists:
        - remove removes the first of the matching Elements.

    - Arrays:
        - can be iterated by an for-each loop. 

    - Switch-Statements:
        - it is possible to write every possible outcome as a Value to a Variable.
            -> example:
                int result =
                    switch (operation) {
                        case "+" -> x;
                        case "*" -> y;
                        case "/" -> y;
                        ...
                    };
        - all kind of Switch-versions are more or less equally performant.

    - O3 ist extrem stark.
